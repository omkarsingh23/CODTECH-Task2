Overview of the Project

Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop a Student Grade Tracker that allows users to input grades for various subjects or assignments, calculate the average grade, and determine the corresponding letter grade or GPA. This program helps students and teachers efficiently manage and assess academic performance.

Project Features:
User Input:

The user can enter grades for different subjects or assignments.
Grades can be entered as numerical values (e.g., 85, 90, 78).
Grade Calculation:

The program will calculate the average grade from the provided scores.
It will determine the letter grade based on predefined grading criteria (e.g., A, B, C, D, F).
It may also convert the average grade into a GPA on a 4.0 scale.
Displaying Results:

Show the individual grades entered.
Display the calculated average grade, letter grade, and GPA.
Error Handling:

Validate user input to ensure only valid numeric grades are entered.
Prevent invalid operations, such as entering negative numbers or non-numeric values.
Technical Aspects:
Programming Language: Python
User Interaction: input() function
Data Storage: List or Dictionary (to store subject-grade pairs)
Operations: Arithmetic calculations for average grade, conditional statements for letter grade conversion
Error Handling: try-except blocks to handle invalid input
